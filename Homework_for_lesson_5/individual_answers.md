## Part 1: Hypothesis Testing recap - Question (1)

For the first example my Null Hypothesis (**H0**) would be:
```
mean_of_dog_weight = mean_of_cat_weight
```


with the Alternative Hypothesis (**H1**) being
```
mean_of_dog_weight != mean_of_cat_weight
```


For the second example the Null Hypothesis (**H0**) would be:
```
pct_of_fans_in_sf = pct_of_fans_in_ok
```

The Alternative Hypothesis (**H1**) here would be:
```
pct_of_fans_in_sf > pct_of_fans_in_ok
```

since it makes sense for a SF team to be more popular in SF.

I would use a chi-square test for these two cases, with the H0/H1 as stated
above.

## Part 1: Hypothesis Testing recap - Question (2)

For statistical significance of 0.05 two tailed Hypothesis the value to
compare with is 2.240 of which the 0.026 calculated rejects the H0 that Pisces
has higher failure rate than Leo.
